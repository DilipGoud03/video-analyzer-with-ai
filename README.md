# video-analyzer-with-ai

A starter project layout for analyzing video with AI tools. This repository provides a place to add scripts that extract audio/video, run models (speech-to-text, vision models, etc.), and produce analysis results. The README below explains recommended dependencies, setup, and usage examples to get you started quickly.

## Features (suggested)
- Extract frames from videos
- Extract audio and transcribe speech with an AI model (e.g., OpenAI/Whisper or other STT)
- Run object detection / classification on frames
- Aggregate results and export reports

## Requirements
This project depends on system-level tools and Python packages.

System requirements
- Python 3.8+
- ffmpeg installed and on PATH (required for many video/audio libraries)

Environment variables
- OPENAI_API_KEY (if you use the OpenAI API)
- Any other model/service keys you decide to use (documented in your scripts)

## Install (recommended)
Create and activate a virtual environment, then install Python dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure ffmpeg is installed on your system. On macOS you can use Homebrew:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
On Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

## Usage (example)
Below are example steps you can adapt to your scripts.

1. Extract audio and transcribe (pseudo-command):
```bash
python scripts/extract_audio.py --input videos/input.mp4 --output audio.wav
python scripts/transcribe.py --input audio.wav --api-key $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

2. Extract frames and run analysis:
```bash
python scripts/extract_frames.py --input videos/input.mp4 --output frames/
python scripts/analyze_frames.py --frames frames/ --model yolov5
```

3. Aggregate results into a single report (CSV/JSON):
```bash
python scripts/aggregate_results.py --input results/ --output report.json
```

(These script names are examples â€” add actual scripts in the `scripts/` directory and update README usage accordingly.)

## Notes and recommendations
- Use python-dotenv or similar to load environment variables from a .env file for local development (remember to keep .env in .gitignore).
- If you plan to use heavy models (e.g., PyTorch/transformers), prefer a GPU-enabled environment and install the appropriate CUDA-enabled torch build.
- For running as an API, consider FastAPI + Uvicorn for serving analysis endpoints.

## Contributing
- Add new scripts under `scripts/` or modules under a package (e.g., `video_analyzer/`).
- Keep requirements in `requirements.txt` up to date.
- Document how to run and reproduce results in README or a docs folder.

## License
Add a LICENSE file (e.g., MIT) if you want an open source license. If you'd like, I can add a LICENSE file for you.

## Help / Next steps
- Add your actual scripts (extract, transcribe, analyze) and I'll update the README usage with real commands.
- If you want, I can create a GitHub Actions workflow, Dockerfile, or example scripts next.
